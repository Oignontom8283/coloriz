# Installing coloriz from the Archive

Here you will find how to install coloriz from an archive downloaded from the coloriz releases page. *(I don't know why you would do this, but anyway...)*

1. Download the archive of the desired version from the [releases](https://github.com/Oignontom8283/coloriz/releases/) page.
2. Make sure you have `npm` installed or *install it by extracting the contents of the archive. (Not recommended)*.
3. Open a terminal in your npm project.
4. Run the following command to install coloriz:
    ```bash
    npm install [PATH/TO/THE/DOWNLOADED/ARCHIVE/coloriz-<VERSION>.tgz]
    ```
    **Replace `[PATH/TO/THE/DOWNLOADED/ARCHIVE/coloriz-<VERSION>.tgz]` with the path to the downloaded archive.**
5. **Done!**
    
    You have just installed an npm module from an archive! ðŸŽ‰ This is absolutely not recommended, but it still works.
